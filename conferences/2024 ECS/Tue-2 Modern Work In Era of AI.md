# Modern Work in the era of AI

SharePoint powers a lot of experiences and lies the foundation for a bunch of features to thrive AI capabilities.
AI integration (now) means up to 7 million reqests per second, 6.5 million cores in use and blocks up to 11 EB's of storage.

## Intranet experience

Upcoming changes make it easier to author sites and pages (content) – in terms of layout, colors and fonts. This will work across multiple experiences (like Viva Aplify etc.), starting from SharePoint Online.

## Administrators

Copilot will be integrated in SharePoint Admin Center, which will be for example be capable to gather overshared site sharing.
_AutoFill metadata_ features will support the ingestion of metadata by extending the document library with additional columns: based on a prompt, new column(s) will be created and metadata will be applied to documents / items automatically.

## Developers' perspective

AI offers a lot of capabilties and improves a "modern" developer in being a "better" developer. But be mindful what you put out into "public zone" (aka "public" Copilot). You can use Copilot to "check" the code base and get improvments and summaries of your work.
