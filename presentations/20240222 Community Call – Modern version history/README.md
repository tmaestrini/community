# Modern version history · A modern approach to handle versions in SharePoint Online

A sample built with [@tanddant](https://github.com/Tanddant) demonstrating how to interact with the Verison history API in SharePoint, built using SPFx.
It modernizes the version history experience in SharePoint Online with a modern UI version of the traditional version history page for SharePoint lists and libraries.
